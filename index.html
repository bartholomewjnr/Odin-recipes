    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p id="recipeDescription"> Chicken Alfredo is a classic Italian-American pasta dish
        known for its creamy and indulgent sauce paired with tender chicken pieces and fettuccine pasta.
        The dish typically features sautéed bite-sized pieces of chicken served atop a bed of perfectly
        cooked fettuccine noodles, all generously coated in a rich and velvety Alfredo sauce.

    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz (225g) spaghetti</li>
        <li>tablespoons olive oil</li>2 
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 oz / 800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Chicken: Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes per side. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Alfredo Sauce: In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the heavy cream and chicken broth, stirring constantly. Allow the mixture to simmer and slightly thicken for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Cheese and Seasonings: Gradually stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried Italian herbs. Continue stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce thickens to your desired consistency. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>Combine Sauce and Pasta: Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve: Arrange the chicken pieces on top of or alongside the Alfredo pasta. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Serve the Chicken Alfredo immediately while it's hot. Optionally, you can sprinkle extra Parmesan cheese on top before serving.</li>
